# Recipe App

Recipe-app using Firebase 9

## Overview

The recipe-app has a frontend in React and a backend in Firebase 9, using Firestore as a database and Authorisation to give users special features in adding, updating and deleting their recipes, while the recipes are readable for all the website visitors. 

## Project timeline 

- started on January, 20th, 2022. 

## Technologies used

- CSS3 
- React 17
- Git
- Github
- Firebase 9

- npm: 'npx create-react-app@latest recipe-app' - npm i firebase' - 'npm install react-router-dom@6'
## Approach taken

The goal to be achieved for the user: 
- Delicious answers to the question of what are we going to eat today? 
- Social Interaction.
- Some added value, more than a cookbook. 

The concept consists of three major blocks. The recipes that are readable by everyone (1). The construction of recipes by users who are logged in with the ability to create, edit and delete their own recipes (2). Optionally, users can give a rating or feedback on the recipes of others. Finally, the link between the created recipes and the data from an API like Fat Secret (3).   

With these three blocks in mind, further development proceeds *agile* with smaller blocks and components. There is no strictly defined 'recipe'. As each main block takes shape, we look at what might be interesting to develop further or what needs to be corrected.

## Step by Step

1. Main concept - ideas - 1u 
2. Create a new react app (create - clean up - favicon)- 1/2u 
3. Setup Firebase (firestore & authentication - npm install - config-file - .env - gitignore) - 1u
4. Routes - 10 min (further thinking about structure -> also detailpages)
5. Navbar 
6. Sidebar (when user is logged in)
7. Signup Page
8. File inputs
9. Link to firebase
10. Profile image
11. User signin
12. User documents
13. Hooks
